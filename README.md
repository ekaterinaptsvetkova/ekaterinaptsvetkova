Hi, welcome to my GitHub page! <br>

My name is Ekaterina.
I am interested in an interdisciplinary approach to data analysis, utilizing concepts from statistics, economics, business, machine learning to uncover new ways to use data for decision-making.

### Languages and Tools
Here are some languages, libraries, cloud services, and IDEs that I like to use.

### Projects
In the past, I've used GitHub as a collaborative tool to complete school work with classmates as well as toto verison control my own projects.

[Here](https://github.com/ekaterinaptsvetkova/tsv_proj_prev) is a preview of one of the coursework projects I completed, an exerpt of my dissertation which uses inferential statistics to compare household spending patterns of different EU countries and evaluates the predictive power of several ML models in relation to forecasting GDP based on spending. 

More projects to come :)
